# Some notes on methodology

The main content on our site is that we group candidates by tier for a given issue. For each of these issues, we have Democratic candidates given a certain priority level. This page explains what we mean when we put a candidate at a given level.

## Priority 1

A Priority 1 candidate supports the cause and their voting record reflects a deep commitment to it. These candidates are often seen as champions of the most critical issues, making them the top choices for fundraising efforts. Methodologically, the selection of Priority 1 candidates involves an in-depth analysis of voting records, public statements, and policy positions. This tier is often reserved for candidates who consistently align with the organizationâ€™s top priorities and demonstrate the capacity to effect meaningful change in line with those values.

## Priority 2

 While not as closely aligned as Priority 1 candidates, Priority 2 candidates have similar ideological leanings for a given issue, though there may be differences in emphasis or approach. These candidates are important allies who can help push forward parts of the agenda, even if they are not as steadfast or comprehensive in their alignment. The process for identifying Priority 2 candidates includes evaluating their stances on the issues, their past performance, and their likelihood of influence on secondary but still significant issues. This tier often includes candidates who are open to collaboration or have potential for deeper alignment over time.

## Priority 3

Candidates in this tier share some values with the organization but may diverge on key issues or have a more limited capacity to advance its overall mission. These candidates may be pragmatically supported for strategic reasons, such as expanding geographic or demographic reach, but they are not seen as central to the organization's long-term goals. Identifying Priority 3 candidates involves analyzing the broader context in which they operate, such as the political environment or their role in coalition-building. They are often seen as having potential to support less critical aspects of the platform or as candidates to watch for future development.
