Let's face it; campaigns are exhausting. Knowing who has a real chance at winning and which candidates are worth laying down your life for or dare we say, your dollars, is about as tough as figuring out how to tell your spouse that your mother's meatloaf recipe is the best. Road to Blue is here to make this frustrating process just a bit more simple. Using industry experts, electoral trends and quite frankly, some common sense,  we are here to take the guess work out of picking which candidates you should fund.  

If you are sick of wondering which candidates are trying to pry the gun from your cold dead hands, or which are just trying to make it a bit harder for 10 year olds to start militias, you have found your home. If you are concerned that the earth may not be around when you finally have that final date on Tinder that leads to a life long partnership, and want to make sure your hard earned dollars are going to candidates who are actively talking about climate change (yeah we said it), then you are in the right place. 

And if you are as concerned as we are about why certain politicians insist on sitting in the corner of your OBGYN's office, then you definitely are in the right place. And if anything in this introduction has offended you, we invite you to visit <a id="red-link" href="https://gop.com">the opposition</a>. But maybe use private browsing so you are spared the targeted ads?
