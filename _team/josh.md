About the same time Greg was graduating from Boston University, Josh was born and raised outside Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, MD.  A graduate of Guilford College in NC, Josh has been involved on political campaigns since the ripe age of 13. After spending 10+ years working in politics, holding positions on Congressional, Senate and Presidential campaigns, Josh discovered that donors often supported candidates that did not share their ideals and that most of this occurred through a lack of proper vetting. Utilizing his experience and leveraging his connections across the political atmosphere, he knows what to ask and what to look for to identify whether a candidate is worthy of support from his clients. Outside of politics, he enjoys playing Tennis, Pickle ball, and Kick Boxing.
