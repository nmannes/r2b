Last year, the DC area did not have any snowâ€¦ but sure, Global Warming does not exist. The following candidates have the courage to say what scientists, mathematicians, doctors and 4 year olds know, that Global Warming is real and human behavior is impacting it. They are bringing real life, practical solutions to the table so we can stop acting like 8 year olds plugging our ears. Yes the environment is fractured but with common sense solutions, we can repair it.
