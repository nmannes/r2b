These candidates are supportive of our countryâ€™s backbone, unions.  They stand with union members, whether they are a teacher, engineer, teamster, or fire fighter, to collective bargain, earn a living wage, have safe working conditions and keep jobs in the U.S.  Many of these candidates are union members themselves and/or grew up in a union family household.   They understand the importance of a strong union movement for our future generations.
