The Second Amendment seems to have gotten a bit away from us. Congress appears to be unable or unwilling to do what the rest of Americans know is needed; to develop common sense gun reform. Sure, it is important to protect law abiding citizens in their right to self defense. But do we really need to ensure that Mickey Mouse can also own a fully automatic machine gun? We do not think so. The following candidates have said they respect the second amendmentâ€¦they just respect life a bit more. And you thought that the GOP had respect for life cornered. Not on our watch!
