If you believe, “Women’s rights are human rights,” these are the candidates for you.
If you believe, “If it’s not your body, it’s not your decision,” these are the candidates for you. And if you agree with Hillary Clinton that, “You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health. And reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal, safe abortion,” then these are the candidates for you. 

"How come when it’s us it's an abortion and when it’s a chicken it’s an omelet?" George Carlin.
