The Israelis/Palestinians conflict is as confusing as your 4th grade girlfriend. We believe that instead of adding more solder to the powder keg that is the middle east, our elected officials should be striving towards sustainable solutions. The following candidates believe fervently in a two-state solution where Israel has the right to exist and the Palestinian people have self determination. They believe that Israelis settlements need to stop expanding and that the Palestinians government must place their people over profits and egos. The Israelis and Palestinians have more in common than what divides them. So letâ€™s elect people who want to only trade jabs over whose hummus is better and which falafel recipe is GOAT!
